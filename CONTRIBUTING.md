# How to contribute

[Shiny Demos](http://shinydemos.com/) is a sample of open Web technologies demos started by [Opera Developer Relations Team](http://dev.opera.com/). But that would not make much sense without your own contributions, doesn't it. So we are waiting for your own contributions. No rewards, no crazy contests, just the simple joy to share together our love for the open Web. Let's push code and pixels.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Start creating a demo using the shiny demos template
* When finished, make a pull request

## What are we looking for?

Shiny demos and double rainbows! Poneys are an option. Basically demos showing how it is possible to use the Open Web technologies. A demo should be working in many browsers, all if possible and should have least code which makes it workable in the future. User feature detections, avoid user agent sniffing.

We will not accept everything. Life is hard. We reserve the right to remove anything which we think doesn't fit into shiny demos. Don't be desperate though. Because even if your demos do not land on shiny demos Web site, it is still a demo usable and accessible to everyone on github.

## Boring licences stuff

* All your contributions (including images, source code, etc) will be under a liberal license (blahblah license).

It means that everything that you will be contributing to shinydemos can be used by anyone else. We don't want to have to enter in complicated legal stuff, do we? Let's just share stuff.

If you are using images be sure there are your owns. Do not reuse images of someone else.
